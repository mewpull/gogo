This is a list of things that need to be worked on.

Code generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Special registers $s1 and $s2 are being used when generating code for arrays.
  This might create a problem when these registers ($16 and $17) are already
  allocated to variables.
  Somethings which are to be kept in mind while fixing this -
    - The newly allocated registers (instead of $s1 and $s2) should be pushed
      back into the heap when they are spilled i.e. the next-use needs to be
      appropriately adjusted.
    - The assembly comments currently being generated need to be somewhat more
      informative.

* Sequential register allocation
  The current ordering of the registers returned by GetReg() are in random order
  probably due to the way container/heap works.

* Generalize the structure of GetReg() across variables and arrays.
  Relevant commit: 52142cc

Parser
~~~~~~
* Fix global declarations.
